# Introduction

Food is an integral part of daily life, not just for sustenance but also for enjoyment and expression. With the rising prominence of online recipe platforms like Food.com, cooking has evolved from being a necessity to becoming an accessible and creative hobby. The digital age has allowed recipes to be rated, reviewed, and shared by millions, offering invaluable insights into public culinary preferences and trends.

This project aims to leverage data science to analyze and uncover patterns within recipes and user interactions on Food.com. Specifically, the research centers around the question:

**"What factors influence the preparation time of recipes, and how can we use these factors to predict recipe preparation time effectively?"**

Understanding recipe preparation times is essential for everyday users planning their meals and for content creators optimizing their recipes for engagement and usability. By identifying trends and predictive factors, this study can help readers better understand the interplay between recipe characteristics and cooking time, making it a practical application of data science.
